LIVING STANDARD AND DISASTER ANALYSIS OF INFORMAL SETTLEMENTS IN KHAN COMMUNITY SOUTH AFRICA

The study identified notable differences between male and female-headed households in terms of education, income, and housing conditions. Additionally, both male and female-headed households face significant challenges related to natural disasters.

Among households that had experienced these disasters, we identified several key trends, including a reliance on community water sources, a high number of self-built homes, and a lack of social education
